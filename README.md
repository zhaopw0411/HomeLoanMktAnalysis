## Problem Statement
Change Financial is a small regional bank headquartered in Washington, DC, and has branches
in surrounding states. It’s time to grow, and Change’s leaders want to know if entering the home
loans market is a smart strategic move. Being an information-driven culture, they first want to
understand their region’s home lending market.


The partners on the Change strategy team have pointed your team towards the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data set collected and published each year by the federal
government and which has basic data on all home loan applications received by lenders across
the U.S. The data is made available for analysis in support of public policy (HMDA History), and
is a valuable as a source of information about the market.


The data team’s idea is to build a data product to help the strategists answer questions about
the regional home loans market; in particular, to help understand both the
“Conventional/Conforming” loans market. This is the first working iteration
with key concerns, and how can help your team work
with the market data.
